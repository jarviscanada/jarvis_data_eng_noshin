What does this app do? why did you learn? 
This JDBC-based application allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a PostgreSQL database using DAO (Data Access Object) pattern. Building this application helped me to learn the basics of using JDBC which is a versatile Java API for accessing any RDBMS. We also learnt to handle SQL exceptions as well as using commits and rollbacks in JDBC.
